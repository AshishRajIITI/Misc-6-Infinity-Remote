# Misc-6-Infinity-Remote

The files index.html, styles.css, index.js, and cross.png show the UI for the remote along with basic functionalities.
The file console.js is the one which we will be injecting into the console using the extension.

It would be great if you open youtube in your browser and copy paste the console.js code and see the functionalities with your arrows.


Update Monday, 28/06/2021:
Added Extension with popup.html, try to download the whole folder and load unpack in chrome://extensions, and then see its working.
It has a few problems now, which includes:
1. search button
2. volume button
3. Carrot down menu in youtube
4. Buttons when the extension is first opened
